# User Details Web Application 

Web application using Spring Boot and Angular.

Use case:
1) The user has to login first to view his details.
2) He can navigate through dfferent menus and options available to him.
3) Logout from the application.

I have created 2 separate applications.
1) AngularStatic for the front-end.
2) rest-web-service for the backend.


TODO.
1) User registration.
2) Security using JWT Token.
